Black Forest Brownie Ice Cream:

Buy or bake approximately 4″x4″ of brownies. Cut the into chunks.
Halve and pit your cherries. In a small saucepan, combine the cherries and granulated sugar over medium heat. Bring to a boil and cook until the mixture reduces by about half (approx. 10 minutes). Set aside to cool.
In the bowl of a stand mixer, beat the heavy whipping cream on high until stiff peaks form. Add the sweetened condensed milk and vanilla extract, and beat until just combined (the mixture should be light and fluffy at this point).
Gently fold the bits of brownie into the ice cream base. Add the chocolate syrup and fold a couple of times until the ice cream has a nice swirl.
Pour half of the mixture into a loaf pan. Spoon half of the cherries over the top. Add the remaining ice cream and top with the remaining cherries. Add the chunks of semi-sweet chocolate.
Put the ice cream in the freezer and allow to set until hardened (about 8 hours). Scoop and serve immediately.
